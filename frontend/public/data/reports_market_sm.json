        "title": "Week Recap: Trump announced new tariffs, but the stock market did not react highly. The S&P 500 closed down just 0.31%. July 7, 2025 ‚Äì July 11, 2025",
        "description": "First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from July 3 to July 11.\n\nThis week started with tariff concerns and ended with tariff concerns. Throughout the week, Trump announced lots of new tariffs on countries and commodities. \n\nüìä Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,\n\nJune 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 üî¥ (-0.15%)\n\nJune 20 close at 5,967.84 - June 27 close at 6,173.07 üü¢ (3.44%)\n\nJune 27 close at 6,173.07 - July 3 close at 6,279.35 üü¢ (1.72%)\n\nJuly 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 üî¥ (-0.31%)\n\nüî∏ Monday: The week started under the tariff concerns, so the stock market opened lower. Before the session, Scott Bessent said we're going to have several trade announcements in next 48 hours. China released gold reserves data and showing it has been buying gold for 8-months. During the session, Trump announced 25% tariff on South Korea and Japan starting August 1. Also, he announced 40% on Nyanmar, 30% on South Africa, 40% on Laos. As a result, the stock market closed down nearly 1%. üî¥\n\nüî∏ Tuesday: The stock market opened flat. We've seen lots of times this opening in the week. Trump said August tariff deadline \"not 100% firm\", but he changed him thoughts and he said deadline won't extended. He also said we're going to send more weapons to Ukraine. Meanwhile, he said 50% tariff on copper and 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals. Elon Musk announced the launch of the 'America Party' and Tesla dropped more than 7%. The stock market closed lower again. üî¥\n\nüî∏ Wednesday: The stock market higher as await trade talks. Trump announced 7 more tariff letters. Also, he continued to attack Powell for rate cuts. The Nasdaq closed record and Nvidia became the first company a $4T milestone. Impressive. The EU commision said it aims to reach a trade deal before August 1. EU progress still slow. The stock market closed higher. üü¢\n\nüî∏ Thursday: The stock market opened flat again. Trump announced 50% tariff on Brazil. It could impact on coffee prices. Gold and Silver continued to rise, but Silver is the star of the week. Interestingly, jobless claims came in below expectations. Fed‚Äôs Daly expects two rate cut in 2025. These news lifted the stock market upper and closed positive. üü¢\n\nüî∏ Friday: Trump announced a tariff 35% on Canada. The stock market opened lower. Silver surged to $38.50 and its highest level since 2011. Trump continued to attack Powell, but he said that asked if he'll fire Powell and said No. The stock market closed lower. üî¥\n\nThe S&P 500 broke 2-week winning streak. Tariff concerns are headlines, but the stock market did not respond highly this before. If there's positive news from EU, Canada or China, it can help to lift the stock market. There was a heavy news flow, but the stock market was quiet. What do you think? How was your week?\n\n‚ùì Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store. If you're using Android, I'm now sure if it's available, but you can try searching \"Stock Map\" or \"Heat Map\". ",

        "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's potential removal of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could lead to a ‚Äòmeltdown‚Äô in currency and bond markets and a spike in inflation expectations, Deutsche Bank said on Friday.\n\nEarlier this week, Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, accused Powell of ‚Äògross‚Äô mismanagement of the Fed and said renovations to the Fed's headquarters were ‚Äòway over budget‚Äô and that the cost of the project had ballooned to about $2.5 billion.\n\nThe allegation could open the door for Trump to seek Powell's removal. The president has repeatedly criticised the Fed chairman for failing to lower interest rates and has hurled a series of insults at him. He has reportedly considered firing Powell and appointing a successor before the end of his term.\n\nGeorge Salaveros, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, noted that the market now expects Powell's ouster to be very unlikely. According to forecasting platform Polymarket, the likelihood of Powell stepping down is currently 15 per cent.\n\nBut Salaveros offered some thoughts on the possible implications.\n\nHe says: \"The empirical and academic evidence on the impact of a loss of central bank independence is fairly clear: in the extreme case, both currency and bond markets could collapse as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall, and broader risk premiums rise due to institutional erosion. Interestingly, the implications for equities are even more ambivalent given that they are ultimately a claim on real assets.\"\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the impact on FX and interest rates, but in the first 24 hours after Powell's announcement of his departure, we expect the trade-weighted dollar to fall by at least 3-4 per cent, while US fixed income will suffer a 30-40 basis point sell-off, led by the back end,‚Äô Salaveros said.\n\nAccording to the analyst, the market's reaction to the initial news will depend on whether the remaining Fed policymakers ‚Äòagree‚Äô around the central bank's independence, the choice of Powell's successor, and the broader macroeconomic context.\n\nHe added: ‚ÄòAll in all, we see Chairman Powell's departure as one of the biggest underestimated event risks in the coming months.‚Äô\n\nThis week, trade dynamics have been at the centre of Wall Street's attention, overshadowing monetary policy and the Federal Reserve.

        "description": "I'm a 33-year-old working professional who wants to save for retirement using ETFs. Initially I wanted a safer portfolio that was adverse to risk, but I've realised that I have time on my side to grow more now. My initial idea was a 60/40 portfolio focused on equity at 60% and bonds at 40%.¬†\n\nHowever, I'm now wondering if it would make more sense to split it a little more heavily in terms of equity over bonds. Maybe 80/20 or even 85/15. I have the years on my side to ride out any dips (in theory). I would transition more towards bonds as I approach retirement in 25-30 years.\n\nI live in Canada, so I would be investing in Canadian funds, but with some diversity when it comes to global reach regarding those ETFs themselves. Does this make any sense or am I way off: \n\nVCN - 30% (Canadian market) \n\nVUN - 35% (US market)\n\nZNQ - 15% (US Tech)\n\nXRE - 5% (Canada real estate)\n\nVSB - 15% (Canadian bonds)\n\nThat would put me at an 85/15 split for equity over fixed income, and a 35% Canada/50% US/15% Canadian Bond split. \n\nI'm aware this doesn't include any global diversifcation at all, so any suggestions there are welcome. Would substituting a combined 10-15% from VCN and VUN into VIU make sense? \n\n",

        "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôm currently exploring international options for property or business investment as well as possible relocation, and New Zealand keeps standing out as a strong candidate. Based on research, here are some key positives:\n‚Ä¢ Pleasant climate, stunning natural scenery, and a clean environment\n‚Ä¢ Polite, well-educated, English-speaking population\n‚Ä¢ Consistently ranks among the top countries for ease of doing business (World Bank, etc.)\n‚Ä¢ Stable political system, low corruption, and transparent institutions\n‚Ä¢ No recent history of wars or major geopolitical conflict in the region\n‚Ä¢ Strong legal protections for private property and foreign investors\n\nBeyond financial reasons, the possibility of relocating there someday is also on the table. It seems like a peaceful, welcoming society with a high quality of life and that adds a lot of appeal from a long-term perspective.\n\nBut of course, what looks great on paper isn‚Äôt always how things play out on the ground. So I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone with direct experience; investors, expats, locals, about the realities of investing and potentially settling there. Some questions:\n1. How open is New Zealand to foreigners buying property or investing in small/mid-sized businesses?\n2. What‚Äôs the current real estate outlook? is there still room for growth, or has the market cooled?\n3. Any issues or restrictions when it comes to:\n‚Ä¢ Transferring funds into or out of the country?\n‚Ä¢ Keeping the source of funds confidential, within legal and compliant boundaries?\n4. Are there any bureaucratic surprises, tax hurdles, or cultural/legal nuances outsiders often miss?\n5. And lastly,how realistic is it to use investment as a pathway to residency or long-term stay?\n\nAppreciate any firsthand insights. Just trying to cut through the polished surface and get a sense of how open and practical New Zealand really is for an international investor.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

The current bank loan is $38000. The ARV would be between $350k and $400k. The grandson is living in the house at the moment and has told me he cannot keep making the payment. The bank is closing in, theybhavevsentninitial letters but no foreclosure has started\n This deal seems like a money maker. I would like to see the grandson leave with something in his pocket. But I know that isn't always possible. My question is, how do I make this deal happen. Yes I have experience investing in real estate, I currently have 33 rental properties and I've done over 15 flips in my lifetime.  What should I do here? Thanks for any help or suggestiions. . ",

Further, there is a risk of depreciation once interests rates are lowered due to more people being able to actually sell their house. Because of this, Ive sat out of the market and have been fully in stocks. My goal was 1 million in stocks, and Im currently on track to hit that number in a year. Following that, I would like to diversify into real estate.\n\nMy strategy:\n\nFor 5-10 years, purchase 5-10 single family houses. All houses must positively cash flow. All houses will be in the 300-600k range. Interest rates must be under a combined 4% (if using gap). I must want to live in the house.\n\nI will purchase the house, live in it for 1 year, then buy another and move. I will continue this for 5-10 years.\n\nDoes anyone see any possible issues I will have buying assumables and eventually renting them out?\n\nThis is not scaleable but easily good enough for me as a diversification hedge away from stocks and significant cash flow when Im older",

        "description": "EDIT: I originally had the tax calculation wrong but fixed it. \n\nI live in South Florida and would love to invest locally, but the numbers just make no sense here. I have built a small out of state portfolio and things are mostly going well, but I'd really like to be closer to my properties and build more local real estate relationships. I'm primarily a cash flow investor.\n\nFor example, in the Midwest, with a little efort I can find a 3/2 home in a C+ / B- neighborhood for $130k which will rent for around 1,300 per month. My taxes will run around $1,000 per year and my insurance will also run around $1,000 per year. Monthly breakdown:\n\n$1,300 gross collectable rent\n\n\\- $130 for property management company\n\n\\- $300 for maintenance/capex\n\n\\- $83 for insurance\n\n\\- $83 for taxes\n\n**= $704 per month in net profit (cash flow) for the Midwest home before accounting for vacancy/leasing costs. That's a 6.5% cap rate or unlevered cash-on-cash return.**\n\nIn South Florida, I'd be spending $350k on a 3/2 in a C neighborhood, which might rent for $3,000 per month. This is the crazy part: taxes would be $7,500 per year and insurance would be $5,000-$6,000 per year. Monthly breakdown:\n\n$3,000 gross collectable rent.\n\n\\- $300 for property management company\n\n\\- $300 for maintenance/capex\n\n\\- $625 for taxes\n\n\\- $417 for insurance\n\n**= $1,358 per month in net profit (cash flow) for the South Florida home before accounting for vacancy/leasing costs. That's a 4.6% cap rate or unlevered cash-on-cash return.**\n\n  \nNow let's assume financing 50% of each of these:\n\n**With 50% financing, the Midwest home still cash flows $282 per month. Not a ton of cash flow to be sure, but it can work.** \n\n**With 50% financing, the South Florida home cash flows $218 per month but you've invested more than 2.5x the amount of money as a down payment, giving you a 1.5% cash on cash return.** \n\nI understand people will say single family homes are not for cash flow, it's an appreciation play, and that multifamily is for cash flow. Well, I've run those numbers too, and it's just as bad.\n\n\n\n**So how is anyone doing this in South Florida? Why are people investing here?** \n",

It seems on some days there is a large discrepancy between how the value of the ETF I'm holding changes, and the index it supposedly tracks changes, and I'd be grateful if somebody can explain why. For example: I hold \"iShares NASDAQ 100 (Acc)\", yesterday, according to my Trading 212 app, rose 0.32%. The actual NASDAQ-100 index rose by 0.72%. Why am I only receiving less than half of the gain that the underlying index achieved?\n\nThanks in advance",

        "description": "Starting last week, we have seen the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum spike. This is from renewed interest from large institutional investors, and the up-coming week of 7/14/25 the US govt is calling crypto week - where they are set to create new standards and adoptions for everything crypto, and how the USA wants to be at the forefront of adopting crypto into everyday investing for the future - so potentially huge news!\n\nLook at this info below I compiled from research, and tell me we are not on the cusp of something BIG?\n\nAccording to recent reports (as of early July 2025):\n\n* **Cumulative Net Inflows:** Spot Ethereum ETFs have accumulated **over $5 billion** in cumulative net inflows since their launch in July 2024. Some reports specify the figure as high as **$5.31 billion**.\n* **Recent Momentum:** Notably, these ETFs have seen a strong surge in inflows recently. For instance, in the first 11 days of July 2025 alone, they recorded **$890 million** in inflows, putting July on track to be their best-performing month since launch. One specific day, July 10, 2025, saw a massive **$383.1 million** in net inflows, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) leading significantly with over $300 million on that day.\n* **ETH Acquired:** Over the past nine trading days (leading up to mid-July 2025), these ETFs have acquired nearly **380,000 ETH**, which is a significant amount and, interestingly, exceeds the total net ETH issuance since The Merge in September 2022.\n\nEthereum has demonstrated fast growth recently and consistent demand, especially in the recent months of 2025. This indicates increasing institutional appetite for Ethereum, and why we are seeing these price increases.\n\nIs anybody watching this current trend also?",

Despite the departure of the Biden administration, Trump reinstated some of the tariffs on Europe prior to his campaign, particularly related to automobiles, precision manufacturing equipment and green energy products.\n\nToday, EU Vice-President Sefcovic made it clear that if negotiations fail, the EU will not hesitate to take reciprocal countermeasures, including imposing tariffs or limits on U.S. high-tech products, cloud services and chip equipment.\n\nShort-term market judgment: \n\nIf the US-EU talks continue to stall, it will weigh on large-cap tech stocks in the short- to medium-term, especially for companies with high international revenue share (e.g., NVDA, AAPL, AMD).\n\nHowever, if positive signals of progress in negotiations can be released later this week, the market will repair quickly.\n\nThe current rise in volatility expectations for August in the options market suggests that institutions are already hedging their bets against conflicting risks.\n\nMy strategy (not a recommendation): \n\nLightly hold tech ETFs (e.g. QQQ) and closely monitor the EU response meeting on 7/16 \n\nIf conflict escalates, plan to buy short-term defensive ETFs (e.g. XLU / SH) if the VIX breaks 15+ \n\nWatch for shifts in international stances during the Biden and Trump campaigns, as the policy set-ups will influence the direction of capital allocation in Sept.\n\nWhat do our Reddit friends think?\n\nDo you think the EU will really do something to counter it, or is it just a bargaining chip?\n\nHow will the escalation of the U.S.-EU trade war affect your holdings (especially tech stocks)?\n\nHow do you plan to hedge your bets if things continue to deteriorate?",

        "description": "Markets rallied yesterday on the back of tech strength particularly Nvidia, which became the first U.S. company to cross a $4 trillion market cap. But while equities surged, serious macro risks are developing under the surface.\n\nPresident Trump announced new tariffs: \n\n50% on copper imports starting Aug 1\n\n20‚Äì30% on seven other countries\n\n50% on *all* Brazilian imports a move explicitly framed as political retaliation, not trade-related.\n\nThis matters: Brazil is the U.S.'s largest coffee supplier. Expect prices to rise and broader trade flows to feel the shock in coming months.\n\nMeanwhile, investor sentiment has reached *extreme greed* levels. Many are ignoring the macro risk buildup, chasing short-term gains driven by FOMO. We've seen this movie before.\n\nFed minutes from June show clear internal disagreement. Some are open to cuts as early as July; others want to wait until 2025. My take: Powell will follow the market‚Äôs lead and deliver a cut in September not just because of inflation trends, but because growth is clearly weakening under the surface, especially with tariff headwinds incoming.\n\n I'm cautious here. Many indexes are now overbought, and lower-quality small caps are getting dragged into the rally a classic late cycle sign. It's time to trim risk, not chase momentum.\n\nWould love to hear how others are positioning into Q3. Are you leaning into the rally, or starting to de risk?",

        "description": "**America‚Äôs Deep-Sea Mining Push: Lockheed Martin Renews Seabed Licenses as TMC and MP Emerge as Strategic Leaders**\n\nThe United States is preparing to invest tens of billions in deep-sea mining as the Trump administration prioritizes rare earth minerals and energy security. Lockheed Martin‚Äôs renewal of its UK seabed mining licenses highlights growing defense interest in securing critical mineral supply. The International Seabed Authority estimates these ocean zones hold roughly 50 times more rare earth minerals than all known land reserves, making them central to future production.\n\nAs the US works to secure non-Chinese supply, exploration rights in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) are key to strategy.¬†**The Metals Company (TMC)**¬†holds contracts covering 224,500‚ÄØkm¬≤ in the CCZ with estimated resources of 15.5‚ÄØmillion tons of nickel and over 12‚ÄØmillion tons of copper, cobalt, and manganese.¬†**TMC**¬†is developing advanced robotic systems to cut seabed disruption and CO‚ÇÇ emissions by up to 90%, meeting tougher environmental standards to win approvals in multiple regions. Unlike traditional land-based mining, this approach avoids deforestation, large-scale excavation, and toxic tailings, offering a significantly lower environmental footprint while unlocking critical mineral resources.\n\nLockheed Martin‚Äôs renewed licenses show continued commitment to maintaining access and technology for defense-related mineral sourcing. Analysts see this as groundwork for future licensing, strategic partnerships, or government-backed offtake deals with operational players like¬†**TMC**, which is positioned to scale production over 100 times its current pilot level with the right investment. Federal funding is expected to support domestic energy independence, advanced extraction, and expanded processing.\n\n**MP Materials (MP)**¬†is positioned to benefit alongside¬†**TMC**¬†as North America‚Äôs main rare earth processor with plans for domestic magnet production. Increased raw supply from deep-sea mining would drive demand for¬†**MP**‚Äôs refining and manufacturing capabilities. As the US builds a secure, integrated supply chain free from foreign dependence, both¬†**TMC**and¬†**MP**¬†are viewed as strategic assets supporting these goals.\n\nMarket projections suggest that with financing, government contracts, and offtake agreements,¬†**TMC**¬†could see significant valuation growth, with scenarios projecting multi-billion-dollar market cap potential. Lockheed Martin‚Äôs move to maintain seabed positions signals that major defense and industry players expect demand for these resources to rise as electrification, defense needs, and advanced manufacturing expand.\n\nThis combination of technology readiness, policy support, and strategic demand makes¬†**TMC**¬†and¬†**MP**¬†stand out for investors watching critical minerals. With Lockheed Martin signaling long-term interest and the US set to prioritize secure, non-Chinese supply chains, these companies are positioned at the forefront of America‚Äôs next resource shift.",

        "description": "Hi everyone,  \nthe automotive industry, might not be able to sustain itself anymore without evolving. The industry its facing a crisis with the continuous fall in demand (talking about the thermal engine car) mainly due to the lack of innovation. Car have become more expensive and deliver less benefits. Not only the aesthetic of a car has decrease but also the authenticity. Moreover the AI industry is booming and a concrete utilization of it is in the automotive sector. I think for the next decade the real winners will be the autonomous driving industry by implementing both hardware and software in a car in order to drive itself without a drive. This industry expands also in the roboTrucks but as well as in minings, agriculture and logistics. However the automotive sector will surely impact for the biggest share as both the consumers as well as the producers will have to evolve to new technologies.  \nWhat are y'all thoughts? ",

Q2 2025 is very likely to be the 7th consecutive profitable quarter since Q4 2023.\n* Every area in SoFi is using AI, and Cash Coach will be SoFi's AI attempt for personal customization for money advice.\n* Over 30% revenue growth, able to maintain more than 30% members and product growth, and don‚Äôt see that slowing down, as mentioned by SoFi‚Äôs CEO on July 10^(th).\n* SoFi is in the run-up trend and will probably break its 52-week ATH multiple times this year. It is the Signs of the Times for Traditional banks as Fintech banks take a much bigger chunk of the financial market. Just like Amazon has dominated the shopping business, while Retail stores are operating on a smaller scale.  The Traditional banks and Fintech banks will coexist, but the Fintech banks are shifting the future of banking by substantially gaining market share to meet the demand of the new generation.\n\nSoFi's fintech primarily comprises two core technologies powered by Galileo Financial Technologies (Originally Galileo and Technisys), which enables SoFi to function as the \"AWS of Fintech.\" This technology sector of SoFi substantially increases revenue with relatively low overhead costs, which will significantly help SoFi stock attain higher multiples than traditional banks.\n\n***1. Galileo provides and processes debit and ACH transactions***¬†on the platform with various APIs that enable developers to build apps on top of it.\n\n***2.

This heat map is weekly that it visualized via closing prices from July 3 to July 11.\n\nThis week started with tariff concerns and ended with tariff concerns. Throughout the week, Trump announced lots of new tariffs on countries and commodities. \n\nüìä Here are the S&P 500's week-by-week results for the last 4 week,\n\nJune 13 close at 5,976.97 - June 20 close at 5,967.84 üî¥ (-0.15%)\n\nJune 20 close at 5,967.84 - June 27 close at 6,173.07 üü¢ (3.44%)\n\nJune 27 close at 6,173.07 - July 3 close at 6,279.35 üü¢ (1.72%)\n\nJuly 3 close at 6,279.35 - July 11 close at 6,259.75 üî¥ (-0.31%)\n\nüî∏ Monday: The week started under the tariff concerns, so the stock market opened lower. Before the session, Scott Bessent said we're going to have several trade announcements in next 48 hours. China released gold reserves data and showing it has been buying gold for 8-months. During the session, Trump announced 25% tariff on South Korea and Japan starting August 1. Also, he announced 40% on Nyanmar, 30% on South Africa, 40% on Laos. As a result, the stock market closed down nearly 1%. üî¥\n\nüî∏ Tuesday: The stock market opened flat. We've seen lots of times this opening in the week. Trump said August tariff deadline \"not 100% firm\", but he changed him thoughts and he said deadline won't extended. He also said we're going to send more weapons to Ukraine. Meanwhile, he said 50% tariff on copper and 200% tariff on pharmaceuticals. Elon Musk announced the launch of the 'America Party' and Tesla dropped more than 7%. The stock market closed lower again. üî¥\n\nüî∏ Wednesday: The stock market higher as await trade talks. Trump announced 7 more tariff letters. Also, he continued to attack Powell for rate cuts. The Nasdaq closed record and Nvidia became the first company a $4T milestone. Impressive. The EU commision said it aims to reach a trade deal before August 1. EU progress still slow. The stock market closed higher. üü¢\n\nüî∏ Thursday: The stock market opened flat again. Trump announced 50% tariff on Brazil. It could impact on coffee prices. Gold and Silver continued to rise, but Silver is the star of the week. Interestingly, jobless claims came in below expectations. Fed‚Äôs Daly expects two rate cut in 2025. These news lifted the stock market upper and closed positive. üü¢\n\nüî∏ Friday: Trump announced a tariff 35% on Canada. The stock market opened lower. Silver surged to $38.50 and its highest level since 2011. Trump continued to attack Powell, but he said that asked if he'll fire Powell and said No. The stock market closed lower. üî¥\n\nThe S&P 500 broke 2-week winning streak. Tariff concerns are headlines, but the stock market did not respond highly this before. If there's positive news from EU, Canada or China, it can help to lift the stock market. There was a heavy news flow, but the stock market was quiet. What do you think? How was your week?\n\n‚ùì Note: Many people have asked where screenshots come from in my previous posts. I'm using Stock+ on iPhone and iPad. You can find it on the App Store. If you're using Android, I'm now sure if it's available, but you can try searching \"Stock Map\" or \"Heat Map\". ",

        "title": "AI to Kill Jobs but Print Money: Here‚Äôs Who Wins (XOM, AMZN, JPM, More)",
        "description": "\nAI might worry workers, but it‚Äôs mostly a profit machine for big names across key sectors. BLS data shows where the gains land:\n\nNatural Resources & Mining : ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP) use AI to cut costs in exploration and maintenance. Good for margins.\n\nConstruction : Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Vulcan Materials (VMC) get safer sites and robot help. Productivity up, expenses down.\n\nManufacturing : Ford (F), GM (GM), 3M (MMM) automate routine work. Savings help earnings but big upfront costs mean mixed short-term impact.\n\nTrade & Transport : Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), FedEx (FDX) slash retail and warehouse labor with AI. Cheaper logistics = fatter profits.\n\nInformation : Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Netflix (NFLX) grow new AI tools fast. More products, more money.\n\nFinance : JPMorgan (JPM), BofA (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) automate back-office tasks. Efficiency lifts earnings.\n\nProfessional Services : Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM), ADP (ADP) profit as firms pay for AI consulting. Clear boost to revenue.\n\nHealthcare & Education : UnitedHealth (UNH), HCA (HCA), CVS (CVS) use AI in diagnostics and virtual care. Better operations, higher margins.\n\nLeisure & Hospitality : McDonald‚Äôs (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Disney (DIS) gain from kiosks but risk weaker customer spend. Net impact mixed.\n\nBottom line: AI cuts millions of jobs but shaves costs, opens new products, and helps margins , a tailwind for corporate profits if they handle it right.",

This is both inflationary and stifles global trade, which should reduce demand for the US dollar and therefore result in selling pressure on US treasuries.\n\nEconomic data has held up for now. The most recent NFP shows the US is not yet in recession.\n\nYet for some reason, 10Y, 20Y, and 30Y treasury yields have barely moved and are actually starting to crawl back down.

I've noticed that the Fed injected $11bn into the repo market on June 30 (their largest involvement in 5 yrs) and Cruz is pitching a proposal to eliminate the Fed's ability to pay interest on reserves.  These things bolster my already developed opinion that soon (0-24 months) the Fed will start dropping rates as much as 1 - 2% and yields on the the front end of the curve will decrease, for various other reasons.  \n\nLet's assume I'm right and, soon, the Fed will drop rates temporarily.\n\nThe many, many thousands of dollars I have in \"cash\" invested in SGOV will be negatively impacted by a drop in rates, yes?  I think I should move that cash into something else before my yields there get eroded, yes?\n\nHelp me out, here's my thought:  Move the cash from a t-bills ETF to a t-notes ETF because it has longer duration and will actually BENEFIT from a drop in the Fed rate.  That's what I'm looking for: profit on the upcoming drop in the Fed rate while still being fairly liquid.  Would a 1-3 yr treasury or 3-7 yr treasury ETF accomplish this?",

That would cause mortgage application to dive, you know, lower shelter cost can also reduce inflation. What a plan.\n\nIn case you don't already know, I am heavily long on stocks (technology and financial, in particular).",

        "description": "I'm a self-made idiot, and I'm trying to follow the macro picture here.  I've noticed that the Fed injected $11bn into the repo market on June 30 (their largest involvement in 5 yrs) and Cruz is pitching a proposal to eliminate the Fed's ability to pay interest on reserves.  These things bolster my already developed opinion that soon (0-24 months) the Fed will start dropping rates as much as 1 - 2% and yields on the the front end of the curve will decrease, for various other reasons.  \n\nLet's assume I'm right and, soon, the Fed will drop rates temporarily.\n\nThe many, many thousands of dollars I have in \"cash\" invested in SGOV will be negatively impacted by a drop in rates, yes?  I think I should move that cash into something else before my yields there get eroded, yes?\n\nHelp me out, here's my thought:  Move the cash from a t-bills ETF to a t-notes ETF because it has longer duration and will actually BENEFIT from a drop in the Fed rate.  That's what I'm looking for: profit on the upcoming drop in the Fed rate while still being fairly liquid.  Would a 1-3 yr treasury or 3-7 yr treasury ETF accomplish this?",

        "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve been working on building an automated strategy for Gold trading (XAUUSD), and I wanted to share a few lessons I picked up in the process. My background is in embedded software development, so this was partly an experiment in translating technical approaches into trading logic.\n\n**3 key lessons I learned:**\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ **Momentum Filters Beat Simple RSI Crosses**  \nRelying only on RSI thresholds resulted in too many choppy entries. When I added a momentum slope filter to confirm directional strength, the quality of trades improved noticeably.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ **ATR-Based Stops Make a Big Difference**  \nFixed pip stops often get wiped out by volatility spikes in Gold. Using ATR multipliers to size stops and targets dynamically made the system more robust.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ **Simplicity Wins**  \nAfter testing lots of extra filters, I realized that a clean strategy with just 2‚Äì3 well-tested conditions performed better and was easier to maintain without overfitting.\n\nI‚Äôm curious‚Äîif you trade Gold, what works best for you? Do you prefer classic support/resistance, trend-following, or reversals with momentum confirmation?\n\nWould love to hear other perspectives and experiences.",

Wore so many different hats/ aprons/ polo shirts and chemical gloves. Even tried running my own business. But it all comes back to this. Now I‚Äôve got to spend my days in the middle of god damn Wyoming away from every one that I love and everything that I care about. And I have a family this time around so I have no idea how that is going to affect me. I suppose that‚Äôs my main motivation behind doing it. I‚Äôm living that stupid fucking Everlast song. \n\n\n4 hours. It took 4 fucking hours to get a response/ interview after applying to just 1 oil field company. 1! I have been looking for sales jobs that pay the bills for years and I even interviewed at C*rm*x last fucking week as a hope for a future career. But no. As a further blow to my consciousness and psyche, I get rejected from as entry level as it gets for that industry. After I thought I killed that interview. \n\n\nI just wanted a normal job and a normal life. But you can‚Äôt always get what you want now can you? Now I gotta deal with 15 hour days getting in fights with ex felons about the stupidest shit in the world, about to be freezing my ass off in Wyoming winters, eating every other meal from a got dang gas station, missing out on my 1 year old daughters life because I literally can‚Äôt make any substantial money doing anything else. I just literally can‚Äôt. I tried. For YEARS. I‚Äôm sorry this is such a poor me situation happening right now I just don‚Äôt know how to cope with it all. \n\n\nI guess I can look at some positives. I was told I am just getting hired on for day shift and there will be no nights. And maybe I only have to do this for just a year. Maybe 1 year won‚Äôt be so bad. I don‚Äôt know though. All I know is that I‚Äôm back. Please drink 8-20 beers for me as I am sober this time around. \n\n",

For reference I will be graduating with a Mechanical Engineering degree next spring. \n\nMy main question is what is the engineering sector looking like in the sector in the Northeast? I‚Äôm from PA so I would like to find a long term landing spot eventually in the Pittsburgh area if possible. The company I‚Äôm working for now does have an office, but due to low rig count they have no need for an engineer up there at the moment. \nI‚Äôve looked into switching to facilities engineering also. I‚Äôm not afraid of moving around early in my career, but want to know if landing in the Pittsburgh area/Northeast is a real possibility in oil and gas in this day and age. My gut feeling is the shale boom is gone and the drilling side of things will never be the same so long gas prices and demand trend the way that they do. ",

    "overall_news_diagnosis": "Based on the comprehensive social media sentiment analysis across the investor's portfolio, the overall diagnosis is as follows:\n\nThe portfolio exhibits a mix of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, reflecting the \"BALANCED\" risk profile of seeking a balance between growth and stability. The negative sentiment towards broad market ETFs like SPY and bond-focused funds like TLT, LQD, and HYG suggests concerns about potential market volatility, rising interest rates, and the impact on fixed-income investments. Conversely, the positive sentiment towards the real estate ETF (VNQ) indicates investor interest in diversifying into alternative asset classes.\n\nThe neutral sentiment towards sector-specific ETFs like QQQ, EEM, XLE, GLD, and USO suggests a cautious, wait-and-see approach, with investors closely monitoring market developments and evaluating the relative merits of these investments. Key insights from the social media discussions include concerns about the impact of policy changes, trade tensions, and inflationary pressures on the broader market performance.\n\nTo align with the investor's \"BALANCED\" risk profile, a strategic recommendation would be to maintain a diversified portfolio, with a focus on reducing exposure to high-risk bond funds and exploring alternative investments, such as real estate, that may provide a balance of growth and stability. Additionally, closely monitoring market trends and adjusting the portfolio accordingly, while considering the potential impact of macroeconomic factors, will be crucial in navigating the current market landscape."
