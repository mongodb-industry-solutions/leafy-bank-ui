      "overall_diagnosis": "Based on the comprehensive crypto portfolio analysis, the overall diagnosis is as follows:\n\nThe current portfolio allocation has a high exposure to cryptocurrencies (85%) and a relatively low exposure to stablecoins (15%). This allocation strategy carries a moderate to high risk profile, as the cryptocurrency assets exhibit bearish trends and negative short-term momentum indicators.\n\nThe analysis of the individual crypto assets reveals that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) are all in bearish trends, with their closing prices below the moving averages (MA9 and MA21) and negative short-term momentum as indicated by the RSI. This suggests a high level of volatility and potential for further downside risk in these assets.\n\nIn contrast, the stablecoins, First Digital USD (FDUSD) and USD Coin (USDC), are maintaining their price stability and peg, with the RSI and VWAP indicators confirming their stability. These stablecoins can provide the necessary portfolio diversification and stability to offset the volatility of the cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nTo optimize the portfolio's risk-return profile, the following recommendations are provided:\n\n1. Reduce the exposure to high-risk cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA) by 20-25% and reallocate those funds to the stablecoins (FDUSD, USDC) to increase the overall portfolio stability.\n2. Consider increasing the allocation to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) as they are currently showing mixed signals, which could provide some upside potential if the market sentiment improves.\n3. Closely monitor the cryptocurrency market trends and momentum indicators, and be prepared to make further adjustments to the portfolio allocation as the market conditions evolve.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the portfolio can achieve a better balance between growth and stability, reducing the overall risk exposure while maintaining the potential for moderate returns."
